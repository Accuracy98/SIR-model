For this project you will be designing and implementing a system to simulate an outbreak across a geographic
region. Specifically, you will be using a cellular automata, with a Moore neighborhood configuration, to model
a geographic region, and a SIR model to model the health states of the populace. Your model should visually
output how the region’s population changes over time, the day of the outbreak’s peak, and the day the
outbreak ended.
In disease modelling, one of the basic models is called the SIR model. SIR stands for Susceptible, Infectious,
and Recovered, which represent the different health states a person can be in with regard to an illness. A
susceptible person is someone who is not sick, but can become sick. An infectious person is someone who is
sick and can infect others with the disease. A recovered person is someone who is no longer sick and has
developed immunity to the disease. For this model, we will be assuming that the immunity is permanent.
To simulate the disease progression across the geographic region, we will be using a cellular automata. Each
cell represents one person’s health state.
