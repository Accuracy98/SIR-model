I implemented a system for simulating an outbreak in a geographic region.  
The model utilized a cellular automaton with a Moore neighborhood configuration to represent the region, and an **SIR** model to capture the health states of the population. The visual output of the model illustrates how the population changes over time, highlights the day of the outbreak's peak, and indicates the day the outbreak concludes. The **SIR** model categorizes individuals into Susceptible, Infectious, and Recovered states, reflecting their health status regarding the illness. In this simulation, we assume permanent immunity post-recovery. Each cell in the cellular automaton represents an individual's health state, allowing for a comprehensive representation of disease progression across the region.
